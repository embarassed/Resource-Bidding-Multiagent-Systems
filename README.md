# Resource-Bidding-Multiagent-Systems
## Computing a Subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for the following scenario.
## Multiple computer users (submission agents) want to submit their jobs to a single computing resource. To do so, they have to bid for the resource with cyber money with each bidding agent starting out with $m in the beginning of the Ô¨Årst round. Each agent can only bid integer amounts and the highest bidder wins the resource (in case of a tie, the earlier of the bids wins). Computing resources become available sequentially and each job needs the same resources and has the same utility ($3) if it is successfully put on the resources (i.e. if the corresponding submission agent wins the bidding). To limit the time it takes to determine a winner, each agent is only allowed one bid with subsequent bidders knowing the value of the previous bids. Every round the agent bidding last in the previous round becomes the one starting the next round of bidding. The submission process continues until all n resource slots are taken (i.e. it repeats for n rounds).
